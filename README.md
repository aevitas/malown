Malown
======

Malown is an extensible messaging service that allows for sending messages via e-mail, SMS, and chat services such as Slack, through multiple third-party providers.

The goal of this project is to provide a simple API for applications to enable notifications, regardless of the external service provider used to deliver those notifications. You could say Malown is an abstraction for the *concept* for messaging.
